VIBE LEVEL: 3 (Features with verification)

COMPLETED:
- Analyzed vibe-check level system - determined ML prediction was "resume-driven development"

- Replaced `vibe-check level` (ML prediction) with `vibe-check start --level N` (declare)

- Implemented watch mode for real-time spiral detection (killer feature)
- Implemented automatic session detection (no manual start needed)
- Added baseline comparison: compares current session to YOUR historical patterns
- Published v1.3.0, v1.3.1, v1.3.2 to npm

COMMITS (3 this session):
- 858ee83 feat(v1.3): replace ML level prediction with session workflow
- eed8163 feat: add watch mode for real-time spiral detection

NEW FEATURES:

DELETED (ML CRUFT):

What's useful is REFLECTION: did reality match your expectation?"
